// remote.go is the charge path for the EXTERNAL billing provider
// (STRATOS_BILLING_PROVIDER=external). It is one of two implementations behind
// internal/platform/billingprovider; the other, and the default, is the billing engine in this
// repository.
//
// The work splits where the in-process driver already splits it: RESOLUTION (read the cloud cache,
// resolve the profile's projects, build billable units) always happens here because it is
// OpenStack-specific and nothing else can do it, and RATING goes to the billing service. The only
// difference from Service.Charge is that the units are POSTed instead of handed to pricing
// in-process.
//
// Note what this path does NOT touch: the local billing repo. The profile work-list comes from the
// billing service, and resolution only needs a profile id to walk orgs → projects → cloud
// resources. The native engine remains fully present and is what a plain checkout of stratos runs.

// Charger is the subset of billingclient.Client the remote driver needs (an interface so the driver
// can be tested without a server).

// ResolveByProfileID builds one profile's charge request from local cloud state.
//
// It mirrors chargeBillingResource's resolution steps: the profile's ENABLED projects that have

// type→Provider registry. Rating inputs the billing service cannot know (the resource-type catalog)
// travel with the request.
