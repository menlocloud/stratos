// Package billingprovider selects which engine charges bills.
//
// Stratos ships a complete billing system: profiles, a rating engine, bills, credits, savings
// plans, dunning and suspension all live in this repository and work with nothing but PostgreSQL.
// That is the NATIVE provider, and it is the default — anyone who checks out stratos gets working
// billing with no external dependency.
//
// Some deployments run a separate billing service instead, with capabilities that do not live here.
// That is the EXTERNAL provider: stratos still resolves what to bill (it owns the OpenStack
// resource cache, and nothing else can) but hands the rating and accrual to that service over HTTP.
//
// The split is deliberately narrow. Only the CHARGE step differs between the two:
//
//	native    resolve -> rate in-process (optionally fanned out across pods via RabbitMQ)
//	external  resolve -> POST the resolved resources to the billing service, which rates them
//
// Everything else — the client and admin REST surfaces, project cost reads, the billing repository
// — is untouched and identical under both providers. That is what keeps the native path a
// first-class citizen rather than a legacy branch: it is not a fallback, it is the default, and the
// external provider is the special case.
