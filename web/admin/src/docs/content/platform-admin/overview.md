# Running the Platform

The operator's job ends where yours begins. Once Stratos is installed, wired to your identity provider, and pointed at your OpenStack clouds, the raw platform is running — but it isn't yet a business. Turning it into one is the platform administrator's work: deciding what you sell, setting its price, controlling how customers get switched on, and making sure the money actually gets collected. Everything below happens in the admin console — the same interface serving these docs.

## A suggested order of setup

Most deployments configure things in roughly this sequence. You can jump around, but pricing tends to come first because everything downstream depends on it.

1. **Pricing** — define your price plans and the resource types they charge for.
2. **Clouds** — register and tune your OpenStack regions.
3. **Activation** — decide how a fresh sign-up becomes a usable account.
4. **Money automation** — invoicing, suspension of non-payers, and sign-up credits.
5. **Branding** — make the platform look like yours.

## Where things live in the console

### Money

Anything financial sits under the **System** group in the sidebar, spread across the **Price plans**, **Taxes**, **Savings plans**, and **Billing configuration** pages.

| What you're configuring | Console location | Guide |
|---|---|---|
| Price plans and their pricing rules | System → Price plans | [Price Plans](/docs/platform-admin/billing/price-plans) |
| The billable resource types and their attributes | Used while building rules | [Resource Types](/docs/platform-admin/billing/resource-types) |
| The platform currency | System → Billing configuration | [Currency](/docs/platform-admin/billing/currency) |
| Per-country tax rates | System → Taxes | [Tax Rates](/docs/platform-admin/billing/tax) |
| Invoice generation and gateways | System → Billing configuration, System → Integrations | [Invoicing](/docs/platform-admin/billing/invoicing) |
| Suspending accounts that stop paying | System → Billing configuration | [Automatic Suspension](/docs/platform-admin/billing/suspension) |
| Credit granted at sign-up | System → Billing configuration | [Sign-up Credits](/docs/platform-admin/billing/signup-credits) |
| Commitment-based discounts | System → Savings plans | [Savings Plans](/docs/platform-admin/billing/savings-plans) |

### Customers

How a new registration turns into an active, provisioned account is covered in [Account Activation](/docs/platform-admin/account-activation). Ongoing customer management happens under the **Client area** group: **Users**, **Organizations**, **Billing profiles**, **Validations**, and **Projects**.

Each project's detail page also carries a **public networks** allow-list. By default a project can use every external network its cloud provider exposes; restrict it to a chosen subset there when a customer should only allocate from specific pools. The restriction is enforced when clients create floating IPs or attach a router's external gateway — a network outside the list is rejected.

### Clouds

Your OpenStack regions are managed from **System → Cloud providers** — registering a region, switching individual services (compute, volumes, load balancers, object storage, shares) on or off, and pulling instance metrics. The Cloud Providers guides cover all of this.

### Look and settings

- **System → Platform** — general platform configuration.
- **System → Instances** — the flavor tiers customers pick from.
- **System → Custom menu** — extra entries in the customer navigation.
- **System → Message templates** — the emails Stratos sends.
- **System → Admin permissions** and **System → API keys** — admin access control and the signed Admin API.
