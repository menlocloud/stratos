# Instance Utilization Graphs

Stratos can show per-instance utilization charts — CPU, memory, and network — inside the client portal. The numbers come from OpenStack's telemetry stack: Ceilometer samples the hypervisors, Gnocchi stores the resulting time series, and Stratos queries Gnocchi to draw the graphs.

> **Billing usage source is a separate, per-provider knob.** The hourly traffic-billing ingestion reads Gnocchi by default, but a provider can be switched to a Prometheus-compatible endpoint (Prometheus, Mimir, VictoriaMetrics, Thanos) or opted out entirely via `PUT /api/v1/admin/service/{id}/metrics-config` (`source`: `gnocchi` | `prometheus` | `none`; admin MCP tools `set_metrics_config` / `test_metrics_config`). Three metric schemas are supported: `libvirt-exporter` (kolla's prometheus-libvirt-exporter), `ceilometer-pushgateway`, and `ceilometer-exporter`. Always run the live probe (`POST .../metrics-test`) after changing it — a misconfigured source does not fail loudly; ingestion just stops and traffic goes unbilled.

## What OpenStack needs first

- **Ceilometer** running and polling compute metrics.
- **Gnocchi** running as the metric backend and reachable from Stratos through the service catalog.

On a kolla-ansible 2025.1 or 2026.1 deployment, enable both:

```yaml
# /etc/kolla/globals.yml
enable_ceilometer: "yes"
enable_gnocchi: "yes"
```

Confirm samples are actually arriving before you switch the feature on in Stratos:

```bash
openstack metric resource list --type instance
openstack metric list
```

## Switching it on in Stratos

Go to **System > Cloud providers**, open the provider, enable the metrics toggle in the **Features** section, and save.

## The client's view

With the feature on, every server's detail page in the client portal grows a set of utilization charts — CPU usage, memory usage, and network throughput — drawn from that instance's Gnocchi time series.

## When the charts are empty

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| No data on any instance | Ceilometer isn't polling, or the Gnocchi endpoint is missing from the Keystone catalog. |
| No data on new instances only | The Gnocchi resource hasn't been created yet, or the Ceilometer polling interval hasn't come around. |
| Memory graph absent | The hypervisor driver doesn't report memory stats; CPU and network still populate. |
