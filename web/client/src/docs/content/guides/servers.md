# Working with Servers

Servers are the virtual machines at the center of most projects. This guide covers the compute resources that surround them — server groups, key pairs, and images — and the day-to-day operations you'll run on a machine once it exists. If you've never launched one, start with [Launch Your First Server](/docs/getting-started/first-server).

Everything here lives under the **Compute** group in the sidebar.

## Launching and sizing

Create a server from **Compute → Servers**. Each machine is built from an **image** (the operating system to boot), a **flavor** (its vCPU / RAM / disk size), a **network** to attach to, a **key pair** for SSH login, and one or more **security groups** for firewalling. Pick a flavor that matches the workload — you can't resize a running machine as casually as you launch it, so err toward what you actually need. The launch form also carries an **Assign floating IP** option, on by default — leave it on and a public IP is attached automatically shortly after the server becomes active.

## Power actions

A server's page exposes the lifecycle controls:

- **Soft reboot** — asks the guest OS to restart cleanly.
- **Hard reboot** — power-cycles the machine when the guest is unresponsive.
- **Stop / Start** — power the instance off and on. A stopped server keeps its disks and network attachments.

When you're done with a machine, **delete** it so it stops consuming compute and accruing charges.

## Server groups

**Compute → Server groups** lets you bundle instances under a scheduling policy — for example keeping members of a group apart on separate hosts for resilience, or together for locality. Create the group first, then launch servers into it.

## Key pairs

SSH access is by key pair, managed under **Compute → Key pairs**. Either upload the public half of a key you already hold, or have the portal generate a pair and download the private key. A generated private key is shown once and cannot be retrieved afterward, so save it the moment it appears.

## Images

**Compute → Images** lists the machine images you can boot from — both those the operator publishes and any you own. Choose one when launching a server; the image determines the OS and the default login user.

## Keeping the console in sync

The status you see on a server reflects the real state on the underlying cloud, kept current by a background sync and by live event notifications. A machine you reboot or delete directly on OpenStack shows the change here too, usually within seconds. For the mechanics, see [How Provisioning Works](/docs/concepts/provisioning).
