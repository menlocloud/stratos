# Object Storage Buckets

Object storage holds unstructured data — backups, media, artifacts, static assets — in S3-style buckets rather than on a disk attached to a server. You'll find it under **Storage → Object storage** in the sidebar.

## Buckets

A **bucket** is a flat container for objects (files), each addressed by a key. Create a bucket, then upload objects into it. Because object storage is reached over an API rather than mounted like a volume, it suits data that many clients read and write independently, that needs to scale without provisioning disks, or that you want to serve directly.

Depending on how your platform is set up, buckets may live on one of two storage backends, shown in the **Storage** column: **Swift** or **S3 (Ceph)**. They are separate systems with separate sets of buckets — a bucket lives on one or the other and can't be moved between them. When both are available the create dialog lets you pick which one a new bucket lands on. The extra S3 features described below apply to **S3 (Ceph)** buckets.

> **S3 bucket names are globally unique.** On the S3 backend a name is shared across the whole platform (just like Amazon S3), so if a name is already taken you'll need to choose another.

## Working with objects

Within a bucket you upload, download, and delete objects, and organise them into folders. The store presents an S3-compatible surface, so existing S3 tooling and SDKs work against your buckets without change.

## S3 access keys

Under **Storage → S3 access keys** you'll find your project's **S3 credentials** — an access key, a secret key, an endpoint, and a region. Point the AWS CLI or any S3 client at them:

```bash
aws --endpoint-url https://your-s3-endpoint s3 ls
aws --endpoint-url https://your-s3-endpoint s3 cp ./file.txt s3://my-bucket/
```

The project credentials have full access to every bucket in the project. Treat the secret key like a password. You can **rotate** it at any time — a new key is issued and the previous one stops working immediately, so update anything that used it.

### Additional keys for apps and teammates

You can also create **additional access keys** scoped to specific buckets — hand one to a backup job, a CDN, or a teammate without sharing the project credentials. A new key has **no access until you grant it a bucket**: open a bucket's **Settings → Access** and grant the key **Read**, **Read & write**, or **Full control**. Revoke it there too. Additional keys can be rotated and deleted independently, and deleting one removes its access from every bucket.

## Bucket settings

Open a bucket's menu and choose **Settings** (S3 buckets only):

- **Versioning** — keep previous versions of every object, so an overwrite or delete is recoverable. Old versions keep counting toward the storage you're billed for; once enabled, versioning can be suspended but not fully turned off.
- **Object lock** — protect objects from deletion for a retention period (write-once-read-many). This can only be chosen **when the bucket is created**, and it turns on versioning.
- **Quota** — cap a bucket's size and/or object count.
- **Lifecycle** — automatically delete objects after a number of days, optionally by key prefix. Useful for logs and temporary files — expired objects stop being billed.
- **Policy** — advanced: paste a raw S3 bucket policy for fine-grained rules.

## Public buckets and static websites

By default a bucket is private — only your keys can read it. You can make a bucket's objects **publicly readable**, or serve it as a **static website**.

Enabling a website turns the bucket into a public site served at its own address (`your-bucket.your-website-domain`), with an index document (e.g. `index.html`) and an optional error document. **This makes every object in the bucket readable by anyone on the internet** — the toggle says so, and disabling it removes public access again. Don't enable it on a bucket holding private data.

## When to reach for it

Prefer object storage over a [block volume](/docs/guides/volumes) when the data is file-shaped rather than a disk: think image and video assets, log and backup archives, build artifacts, or anything a web front end serves directly. Reach for a volume instead when a single server needs a real filesystem it can mount and run a database or application on.
