# Contributing to Stratos

Thanks for your interest in improving Stratos. This guide covers local setup,
the build/test commands, and how changes flow from a branch to `main`.

By participating you agree to abide by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Prerequisites

- **Go 1.25+** — the backend.
- **Node.js 20+** and npm — the two React consoles under `web/`.
- **Docker** — required for the integration tests (they spin up a throwaway
  PostgreSQL via testcontainers) and for building images / running the local stack.
- Optional for a full run: an **OpenID Connect** issuer (Keycloak or other) and
  an **OpenStack** region. Auth-gated and cloud routes stay dark without them.

## Getting the app running locally

The fastest path is Docker Compose, which brings up the API, both SPAs, PostgreSQL
and RabbitMQ:

```sh
docker compose up --build
```

- API: `http://localhost:8080` (management port `http://localhost:8081`)
- Customer console: `http://localhost:8082`
- Operator console: `http://localhost:8083`

Set OIDC / OpenStack values in a `.env` file (keys are documented inline in
`docker-compose.yml`) to exercise authenticated and cloud flows.

### Running pieces individually

Backend:

```sh
go run ./cmd/api
```

Config is read from `application.yml` (if present at
`/opt/stratos/api/application.yml`) with environment-variable overlays — see
`internal/config/config.go` for the full contract.

Frontends:

```sh
cd web/client   # or web/admin
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build, test, and lint

Backend (via the `Makefile`):

```sh
make build             # go build ./...
make vet               # go vet ./...
make test              # go test ./...
make test-integration  # go test -tags=integration ./test/integration/... (needs Docker)
make binary            # static binary -> bin/stratos-api
make image             # docker build -f deploy/Dockerfile
```

Before opening a PR, make sure the code is formatted and vetted:

```sh
gofmt -l .   # should print nothing
go vet ./...
go test ./...
```

Frontends:

```sh
npm run lint    # oxlint
npm run build   # tsc type-check + production build
```

### Integration tests

Integration tests live in `test/integration` behind the `integration` build tag,
so `go test ./...` skips them by default. Run them explicitly with `make
test-integration` (or `go test -tags=integration ./test/integration/...`). They
require Docker to be running; each run gets a fresh, disposable PostgreSQL.

## Project layout

See the [repository layout table](README.md#repository-layout) in the README.
In short: HTTP entrypoint and job wiring in `cmd/api`, business domains in
`internal/platform/<domain>`, OpenStack integration in `internal/cloud`,
reusable libraries in `pkg`, deployment assets in `deploy`, and the two consoles
in `web/`.

### Adding a domain or endpoint

- A business domain is a package under `internal/platform/<domain>`, typically
  with its repository (Postgres access), a service (business logic), and HTTP
  handlers. Follow the shape of an existing domain such as `project` or
  `billing`.
- Cloud/OpenStack behavior belongs in `internal/cloud` (providers, sync,
  metrics, notifications).
- Wire new routes into the appropriate surface in `cmd/api/main.go`:
  - `/api/v1` — the customer API,
  - `/admin-api/v1` — the operator API (SigV4-signed),
  - `/mcp` — the Model Context Protocol server.
- Add or extend tests. Prefer a fast unit test next to the code; use
  `test/integration` when behavior needs a real PostgreSQL.

## Branch & PR flow

1. Branch off `main` (e.g. `feat/savings-plan-rollover`, `fix/invoice-rounding`).
2. Keep commits focused. Commit subjects follow a
   [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) style
   (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, …) — the same prefixes CI uses for
   automated chart releases.
3. Ensure `gofmt`, `go vet`, `go test`, and (for UI changes) `npm run lint` and
   `npm run build` all pass.
4. Open a pull request against `main` and fill in the
   [PR template](.github/pull_request_template.md). CI builds the images and, if
   you touched `deploy/charts/stratos/**`, requires a `Chart.yaml` version bump.
5. Address review feedback; a maintainer merges once CI is green.

## Reporting bugs & requesting features

Use the [issue templates](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE). For anything security-related,
please follow [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) instead of opening a public issue.
