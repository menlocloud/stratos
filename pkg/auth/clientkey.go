package auth

// clientkey.go authenticates a client Personal Access Token (PAT) presented as
// `Authorization: Bearer <pk>.<sk>` — a self-service credential a client-web user mints to reach
// the client API and the client MCP toolset (e.g. from a Terraform module) without an interactive
// SSO session.
//
// The token behaves EXACTLY like that user's OIDC session downstream: the principal is the token's
// owning user (Sub) scoped to the main (client) realm issuer, so every handler's own-record / org /
// project policy applies unchanged and the token is never treated as admin (isAdmin checks the
// admin/admin-api realms only). PATs live in a SEPARATE collection (client_api_keys) from the admin
// hmac_keys — physical isolation, so a client PAT can never resolve on the Admin-API SigV4 path and
// an admin key can never resolve here.
