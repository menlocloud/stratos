# Stratos documentation

Contributor and operator documentation for Stratos — a self-service platform for
selling, billing, and operating OpenStack cloud capacity (a Go backend, two React
19 SPAs, and a Helm chart).

> **Audience.** These docs are for people working *on* Stratos. End-user and
> operator product help ships inside the SPAs themselves at `/docs` — a different
> audience and a separate source.

## Getting started

- [development.md](development.md) — prerequisites, build, run the full stack with
  `docker compose`, run the backend and SPAs locally, seed config, point at a dev
  cloud, and the edit/run loop.
- [configuration.md](configuration.md) — the full configuration contract:
  `application.yml` keys and the environment variables that override them.

## Architecture

- [architecture.md](architecture.md) — the big picture: the single API binary,
  the handler→service→repo layering, the SPAs, and how they fit together.
- [data-model.md](data-model.md) — the PostgreSQL/JSONB document model, the core
  aggregates and their tables, id and serialization conventions.

## Subsystems

- [auth.md](auth.md) — the OAuth2/OIDC resource server, realms per audience, and
  SigV4 keys for the public admin API.
- [billing.md](billing.md) — price plans and rules, rating and bills,
  transactions, account credit, savings, promotions, activation/suspension.
- [cloud-integration.md](cloud-integration.md) — the OpenStack facade: external
  services, the resource cache, sync, metrics, and notifications; plus the
  Ceph RGW S3 object-store backend that runs alongside it.
- [openstack-notifications.md](openstack-notifications.md) — operator guide:
  wiring OpenStack/RabbitMQ events into the near-real-time notification webhook.
- [jobs-scheduling.md](jobs-scheduling.md) — scheduled jobs, the PostgreSQL
  distributed lock, and the optional RabbitMQ charge fan-out.

## Reference

- [api.md](api.md) — the HTTP surfaces: the customer `/api/v1`, the operator
  admin routes, the public `/admin-api/v1`, and the `/mcp` endpoint.
- [glossary.md](glossary.md) — domain vocabulary (organization vs. project vs.
  billing profile, user vs. member vs. owner, pricing terms, and more).
- [testing.md](testing.md) — unit tests and the tag-gated integration suite
  (testcontainers PostgreSQL), what's covered, and how to add a test.

## Decisions

Architecture Decision Records ([adr/](adr/)) — the load-bearing choices and their
rationale, in Nygard format:

- [ADR-0001](adr/0001-record-architecture-decisions.md) — Record architecture
  decisions.
- [ADR-0002](adr/0002-go-and-layered-architecture.md) — Go with a
  handler→service→repository layering over the document store.
- [ADR-0003](adr/0003-auth-as-oauth2-resource-server.md) — Authenticate as an
  OAuth2/OIDC resource server (plus SigV4 for machines).
- [ADR-0005](adr/0005-self-contained-helm-chart.md) — A self-contained Helm chart
  with optional bundled backing services, released to ghcr.
- [ADR-0006](adr/0006-mcp-in-process-dispatch.md) — Expose an MCP server that
  dispatches in-process through the existing API.
- [ADR-0007](adr/0007-distributed-job-locking.md) — Run scheduled jobs under a
  distributed lock, with optional broker fan-out.
- [ADR-0008](adr/0008-postgres-jsonb-document-store.md) — PostgreSQL + JSONB as
  the document store (supersedes ADR-0004's engine choice).
